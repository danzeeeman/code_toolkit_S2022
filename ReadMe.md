# __CODE TOOLKIT SPRING 2022__
# Week One Lecture Notes
### _Who?_
I'm Dan Moore, I'm an Artist, Designer, and Technologist based here in New York City.  I have a desk and robot arm at Pratt Institute's Consortium for Research & Robotics (CRR) in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  I design and build interactive activations and applications.  

I leverage media frameworks, game engines, textiles, and robotic arms to create immersive environments that examine human behavior, pop-culture, and culture dichotomies. My work is inspired by the idea of HYPE and the manipulation of media to achieve it. I strive to create a fully immersive environment for the audience to not only experience but become an active participant in the work.

Recently, I've been creating sneakers with machine learning and calling them [*airegan](www.aire-gan.com)

I've worked at a UX design studio inside Samsung Mobile, a couple tour's of duty at the Google Creative Lab where I led the development of [Just A Line](https://justaline.withgoogle.com),  prototyped an early version of [Verne](https://verne.withgoogle.com), prototyped the [Morse Code gBoard](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9011881?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid), and prototyped the [Notable Women](https://notablewomen.withgoogle.com) AR experience.  I've worked with advertising agencies, experiential agencies, and architecture firms to build interactive installations such as creating a video game with a car, an F1 driver, a Player, and an iPad called [Trace Your Road](https://vimeo.com/74125559).  I led a team at Squarespace doing conceptual product design.  I'm currently contracting at NVIDIA working with their creative team on tools and workflows for virtual projection, including motion capture and integrations with robotic arms.
