// the setup function gets called to kick everything off
function setup() {
  createCanvas(500, 500);
  noStroke()  

  fill(255, 255, 0);
  rect(0, 0, 250, 250);
  
  fill(255, 0, 255);
  rect(250, 0, 250, 250);
  
  fill(255, 255, 0);
  rect(250, 250, 250, 250);
  
  fill(255, 0, 255);
  rect(0, 250, 250, 250);

## Variables    
### What is a variable?  
  
- A way to introduce variation on a theme, generalization within a formal structure, or the abstraction of some parts of a process. The word comes from vary like variety and variance, and means a thing that is able to change.
- A variable is a placeholder. A placeholder for a value. Instead of using a specific value (like a number), you create a name, and then use that name in your code. When looking at your code, you don't know exactly what the value of that variable is. You can set it to a specific value, or change that value later. This means that one bit of code is now able to do different things.
- A variable is a way to store something in memory so you can access it later in your code.
#### _Who remembers algebra?_
  ```
  y = m * x + b aka the formula for a line
  ```

```Y``` is equal to the variable ```M``` times the variable ```X``` plus the variable ```B``` this gives us the forumla of a line where ```M``` defines the slope of the line and ```B``` define the point that the line crosses the ```Y``` axis, when ```x = 0```.

  ```
  a**2 + b**2 = c**2 aka Pythagorean Theorem
  ```
#### _Did anyone take Physics?_
  ```
  force = mass * acceleration 
  ```
####  _Did anyone take Calculus?_


So lets talk about how you create a variable in code. The word for that is _declare_. 

This is how you _declare_ a variable in p5.js.

```
let x;
```

Before you can use a variable you have to assign it a value.

This is how you _assign_ a variable in p5.js.
```
let x; 
x = 10;

or 

let x = 10;
```

There are three places where you can _declare_ a variable

- Inside a _function_ or a _code block_ which is called _local variables_

```
function setup()
{ 
    let x;
    print(x)
}
```

- In the definition of function parameters which is called _parameters_
```
function setup()
{
    print(getValue(100));
} 

function getValue(t)
{
    return t*0.01;
} 
```

- Outside of all _functions_ which is called _global variables_
```
let x;
function setup()
{
    print(x);
}
```
### Variable Names 
* must start with a letter or an underscore character
* cannot start with a number
* can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and _)
* are case-sensitive (treeheight, TREEHEIGHT, TreeHeight, and treeHeight are all different variables)

![Matrix](images/matrix_var_names.jpg)

My advice is 

```
camelCase
let makeItEasyToRead = 1;

snake_case
let make_it_easy_to_read = 1;

camelCase
let makeItMeanSomethingUnique = 1;

snake_case
let make_it_mean_something_unique = 1;
```

You can store multiple types of data as a variable.
- strings ```"Yo Some Words"```
- floats ```0.01f```
- integers  ```5```
- booleans ```True/False```  
- and more complex data types (we'll get to that much later on in the course)

lets look at some [code](https://editor.p5js.org/danzeeeman/sketches/kAGXxWYRf)

## Arithmetic
![basic_math](images/1zp2du.jpg)
### basic math and some __funky__ _shit_
* add (+)
  * 1 + 1 = 2
  * 1++ = 2
* subtract (-)
  * 1 - 1 = 0
  * 1-- = 0
* multiply (*)
  * 2*2 = 4
  * 4*4 = 16
* divide (/)
  * 2/2 = 1
  * 1 / 2 = 0.5
* pow (**)
  * 2**2 = 4
  * 3**4 = 81 
* modulus (%) 
  ![wft](images/1y62g6.jpg) 
  *  1 % 4 = 1
  *  2 % 4 = 2
  *  3 % 4 = 3
  *  4 % 4 = 0
  *  5 % 4 = 1
  *  6 % 4 = 2
  
  ## ```random()```
  ```
    let r = random(50);
    stroke(r * 5);
    line(50, height/2, 50 + r, 0);
  ```

One thing that works really nicely with variables is creating randomized variation of those variable values.  In p5.js, this is done with the function ```random()```. ```random()``` returns a floating point (a number with a decimal point).
Like this:
```
	  firstSquareHeight = random(10,300)
```
The parameters to ```random()``` are minimum and maximum values. They define a range from which ```random()``` chooses a number. Like asking a person to "pick a number between 10 and 300".

Here is how we could use random values to draw the above composition:

```
  squareWidth = random(10,300) # variable assignment (creates the variable)
  firstSquareHeight = random(10,300)

  size(600, 600)
  background(255)
  stroke(100, 100, 100)

  fill(255, 100, 100, 100)
  rect(250, 100, squareWidth, firstSquareHeight)

  fill(255, 255, 100, 100)
  rect(250, 100 + firstSquareHeight, squareWidth, 100)

  fill(100, 100, 255, 100)
  rect(250, 100 + firstSquareHeight + 100, squareWidth, 100)
```
Stop and run that a few times to see what kinds of variation we've just created.

function setup() {
  image(img, 0, 0);
