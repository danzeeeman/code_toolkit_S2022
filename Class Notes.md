# CODE TOOLKIT SPRING 2022
# Week One Lecture Notes
## _Who?_
I'm Dan Moore, I'm an Artist, Designer, and Technologist based here in New York City.  I have a studio at Pratt Institute's Consortium for Research & Robotics (CRR) in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  I design and build interactive activations and applications.  I've got a official bio (possibly dated) on my website [Make It Do A Thing](www.makeitdoathing.com).  

I leverage media frameworks, game engines, textiles, and robotic arms to create immersive environments that examine human behavior, pop-culture, and culture dichotomies. My work is inspired by the idea of HYPE and the manipulation of media to achieve it. I strive to create a fully immersive environment for the audience to not only experience but become an active participant in the work.

Much of my work takes the form of postvideo nongames, a concept and phrase confined by me to describe virtual environments and virtual realities I build with a game engine that employs an abstract, non-linear narrative and lacks the traditional video game risk-reward feedback loop.  In my work, the audience is given agency to explore the world on their own terms with the opportunity to play, discover, and destroy the environment around them.  My work explores the performative nature of the interactions between the audience and his work often capturing these artifacts. The episodic nature of my work can be seen in his many ongoing series and editioned installations.

Recently I have been creating sneakers with machine learning at [*airegan](www.aire-gan.com)

I've worked at design studios in Samsung, a few tours at the Google Creative Lab, worked for advertising and experiential agencies, architecture firms, led my own team at Squarespace, and I'm currently at NVIDIA working with Robotics and Virtual Production.
