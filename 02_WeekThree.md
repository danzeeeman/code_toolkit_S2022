# Week 3 â€“ Debugging & Adding interactivity
## Debugging
The joys of ```console.log()``` and ```print()``` and ```breakpoints```

## Mouse Interaction

```mouseX, mouseY```
```
function draw() {
  stroke(0, 0, 0, 100);
  line(mouseX, 0, mouseX, 100);
  line(0, mouseY, 100, mouseY);
}
```

_a little bit of calculus_
![calc](images/3xksjp.jpg)

Say you wanted the calculate the _acceleration_ of your mouse movements and tie that to your program.  You also want to calculate the _velocity_ of the mouse movements. 

So what is the velocity of an object? It's the _derivative_ of the position function.

[Example](https://editor.p5js.org/danzeeeman/sketches/8jrx0Enj8)
```
v_x(t)=d/dt(x(t))
v_y(t)=d/dt(y(t))
```
so really whats a _derivative_?  Its the difference between the output of a function with respects to time.  It's the difference over time. 

_How can we compute the difference of position over time?_

Well if we know the position of the mouse at each frame given as ```mouseX``` and ```mouseY``` we can store those values and use them to compute the difference in position also known as the _velocity_ and then store that value to compute the difference in _velocity_ or the _acceleration_ of the mouse;

```
// position cache
let previous_mouseX = 0;
let previous_mouseY = 0;
//velocity
let velocityX = 0;
let velocityY = 0;
let previous_velocityX = 1;
let previous_velocityY = 1;
//acceleration
let accelX = 0;
let accelY = 0;
let previous_accelerationX = 1;
let previous_accelerationY = 1;
// min max 
let maxVelocity = 0;
let maxAccel = 0;
// should really make it max int
let minVelocity = 100;
// should really make it max int
let minAccel = 100;
function setup(){
  createCanvas(512, 512);
}

function draw(){
    calcVelocity();
    calcAcceleration();
    cachePrevious();
    drawMotion();
}

function calcVelocity(){
    velocityY = mouseY - previous_mouseY;
    velocityX = mouseX - previous_mouseX;
    maxVelocity = max(velocityX, maxVelocity);
    maxVelocity = max(velocityY, maxVelocity);
    minVelocity = min(minVelocity, velocityX);
    minVelocity = min(minVelocity, velocityY);
}
function calcAcceleration(){
    accelX = velocityX - previous_velocityX;
    accelY = velocityY - previous_velocityY;  
    maxAccel = max(accelX, maxAccel);
    maxAccel = max(accelY, maxAccel);
    minAccel = min(minAccel, accelX);
    minAccel = min(minAccel, accelY);
}
function cachePrevious(){
    previous_mouseX = mouseX;
    previous_mouseY = mouseY;
    previous_velocityX = velocityX;
    previous_velocityY = velocityY;
}

function drawMotion(){
  background(0, 0, 0);
  fill(255, 255, 0);
  rect(0, 0, map(velocityX, minVelocity, maxVelocity, 0, 512), height/4);
  fill(255, 0, 255);
  rect(0, height/4, map(velocityY, minVelocity, maxVelocity, 0, 512), height/4);
  fill(255, 255, 0);
  rect(0, 2*height/4, map(accelX, minAccel, maxAccel, 0, 512), height/4);
  fill(255, 0, 255);
  rect(0, 3*height/4, map(accelY, minAccel, maxAccel, 0, 512), height/4);
}
```

## map() 
```map()``` is a very useful function.  It is a shortcut for this mathematical operation that takes a value in a range between two numbers ```[input_start, input_stop]``` and remaps it to a value in another range defined by two numbers ```[output_start, output_stop]```.

```
function map(value, input_start, input_stop, output_start, output_stop) {
    return output_start + (output_stop - output_start) * ((value - input_start) / (input_stop - input_start));
}
```

So in other words it remaps a value from one range to another.  So if I had the output of a sin wave going from ```[-1, 1]``` and wanted to use that value draw a rectangle along the x axis of my window I could do this:

```
let value = sin(frameCount%500/500);
let mapped_value = map(value, -1, 1, 0, width);
rect(mapped_value, height/2, 50, 50);
```


## for() loops
You've seen a for loop before in some examples but we will look at them more today.

```
let some_number = 10;
for(let i = 0; i < some_number; i++){
    drawShape(i);
}
```

_So what does this tell the computer to do?_

### Nested for() loops
```
let some_number = 10;
for(let i = 0; i < some_number; i++){
    for(let j = 0; j < some_number; j++){
        drawShape(i, j);
    }
}
```
_So what does this tell the computer to do?_

### Comparing everything to everything else
```
let some_number = 10;
let list = [10, 9, 12, 25, 14, 4, 6, 10];
for(let i = 0; i < list.length; i++){
    for(let j = i; j < list.length; j++){
        compare(list[i], list[j])
    }
}
```
_So what does this tell the computer to do?_

_where is this useful?_ 
 * collision detection algorithms
 * particle systems repulsion algorithms 
 * map making
 * distance checking
